THIS CODE IS ALL IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN

This is a converter to possibly the most inefficient image format ever
devised. You'll need pygame to use it, as well as Python with turtle
(eg. CPython 2.6)

Given an image filename and an output filename, like this:

python TurtleConvert.py MyImage.png MyImage.py

The file MyImage.py will be created containing Python code to draw the
given image, in black and white, using the LOGO-style turtle module.

The output given is the number of pixels left to process. When it
reaches zero it's done, and you can run the output file to draw the
image.

This is just an experiment for fun. I hope you enjoy it :)

TODO

Replace pygame with an imagemagick-style library?
Use dithering to convert to black and white, rather than thresholds
Optimise the output code:
	* goto considered harmful (plus it makes things too easy ;) )
	* check for straight lines, rather than simply neighbours
	* when stuck, go to nearest black spot, rather than popping the list
	* add full colour?
